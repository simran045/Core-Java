# Core-Java


## Object Oriented Programming , Classes, Objects ,Methods, Constructor 

1. Create a class to calculate Area of circle with one data member to store the radius and another to store area value. Create method members - <br>
          ● init - to input radius from user
          ● calc - to calculate area
          ● display- to display area
          
2. Create a class MathOperation with two data member X and Y to store the operand and third data member R to store result of operation.Create method members - <br>
          ● init - to input X and Y from user
          ● add - to add X and Y and store in R
          ● multiply - to multiply X and Y and store in R
          ● power - to calculate X Y and store in R
          ● display- to display Result R
          
3. Create a class MathOperation containing method ‘multiply’ to calculate multiplication of following arguments - <br>
          ● two integers
          ● three float
          ● all elements of array
          ● one double and one integer
          
4. Create a class Person with properties (name and age) with following features - <br>
          ● Default age of person should be 18;
          ● A person object can be initialized with name and age;
          ● Method to display name and age of person

5. Create and use copy constructor for above problem no 4.

6. Create a class Employee with(empNo ,salary and totalSalary) ) with following features - <br>
          ● Only parameterized constructor;
          ● totalSalary always represent total of all the salaries of all employees created.
          ● empNo should be auto incremented.
          ● display total employees and totalSalary using class method.
